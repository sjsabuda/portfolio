<p>Here's a little about my mom:</p>
<p>She is currently a senior at the University of Michigan studying UX Design at the School of Information there. She is moving to the DC area after we graduate. I can't wait to explore the east side! We love going to eat at dog friendly caf√©s and going to dog parks.</p>
<p>I am her first dog. She did a lot of research before getting an Australian Shepherd as a dog. She wanted a dog who was smart and kept her occupied and active!! Little did she know that I am the laziest dog in the world, so I do not require too much activity. She is okay with this.</p>
<p>She is weirdly obbsessed with me and buys me a lot of treats and toys. She even has a subscription to BarkBox (which she thinks is the best thing ever because she never has to buy me toys or treats outside of that if she doesn't want to!</p>
