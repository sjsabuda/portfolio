<br>
<p>I am a Miniature American Shepherd (or more commonly known as a Mini Australian Shepherd or Mini Aussie). We are a medium size dog breed that were developed in the USA despite our Australian name. We are similar to Border Collies and like to herd animals like sheep! I haven't actually ever herded a living animal (besides some small children and my toys). We are still used on a lot of farms throughout the world and love to help! Since we are so smart, we are also used for service dogs, search and rescue dogs, therapy dogs, guide dogs, etc.</p>
<br>
<p>One thing that everyone should know about Australian Shepherds (and other merle breeds) is the potential for a Double Merle. Double Merles happen when two merles are bred together. Their litter results in 25% of them being Double Merles which are excessively white. Unfortunately, this also means they are usually deaf, blind, and have numerous other health issues. With the increase in popularity of Aussies, it is important to be aware of Double Merle breeding! These doggies are still just as lovable and adorable as I am, but a lot of them end up being euthanized because they cannot find a home. </p>
<br>
<p>I am currently two years old. I am a red merle. The red means brown and the merle means spotted. So I am brown and spotty! I also have heterochromia which everyone seems to think is really cool. My right eye is light blue and my left eye is a brownish green. My birthday is on January 18th 2018, the day right after my mom's! I love to play with my plushy toys and destuff them! I also like to play fetch. But I only want you to throw. No take.</p>
<br>
<p>In my free time, I enjoy going on walks with my human, play with my many girlfriends, and hanging out with all my human friends. I am very lazy and cuddly, and everybody loves me. My mom spoils me by giving me baths, brushing me, trimming my butt fur, and cutting my nails. She also brushes my teeth and gives me this minty gel that I hate! But it is supposed to keep my breath and teeth clean.</p>
